# Machine Learning-Driven Framework for Life Cycle Assessment and Optimization of Hydrogen Production Technologies

## Overview
This project focuses on evaluating and comparing the environmental sustainability of biomass gasification technologies for hydrogen production through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The framework analyzes four promising gasification pathways:
- Steam Gasification
- Supercritical Water Gasification (SCWG)
- Plasma Gasification
- CO₂ Gasification

## Methodology
The LCA is conducted using:
- **Software**: openLCA
- **Database**: ecoinvent 3.7.1 cutoff unit regionalized database
- **Data Sources**: Scholarly and institutional sources
