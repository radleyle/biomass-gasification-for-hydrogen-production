# Supercritical Water Gasification: Hydrogen Yield Analysis

## 1. Overview of Research Findings

This report synthesizes findings from recent studies on supercritical water gasification (SCWG) focusing on hydrogen yield, specifically in terms of mol/kg or mmol/g units. The analysis emphasizes the need for comprehensive experimental data, including feedstock types, operating conditions, and yield metrics.

## 2. Papers Reporting Yields in MOL/KG or MMOL/G Units

### Identified Papers

| Paper Title | Feedstock Type | Yield Data | Operating Conditions | Reactor Configuration |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| "Hydrogen-rich syngas production from food waste via supercritical water gasification: Influence of gasification conditions" (2025) | Food Waste | Not specified | Not specified | Not specified |
| "Supercritical Water Gasification of Ethanol as Biomass Model Compound in Tandem with Steam Reforming" (2024) | Ethanol | Not specified | Not specified | Not specified |

### Key Observations
- Both papers require access to full texts for detailed yield data and experimental conditions.
- No quantitative data points are available in the previews, indicating a gap in accessible information.

## 3. Conversion Factors and Unit Standardization

- **MOL/KG to MMOL/G Conversion**: 
  - 1 mol/kg = 1000 mmol/g
- **Standardization Method**: 
  - Ensure all yield data is reported in consistent units for comparative analysis.

## 4. Feedstock-Specific Data

### Biomass Identification
- **Food Waste**: A promising feedstock due to its abundance and potential for high hydrogen yield.
- **Ethanol**: Used as a model compound for biomass, allowing for controlled studies on gasification processes.

## 5. Tabulated Results

### Example of Expected Data Table (Hypothetical)

| Feedstock Type | Yield (mol/kg) | Operating Conditions | Statistical Analysis |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Food Waste     | 2.5            | 400°C, 25 MPa        | ±0.1 (n=3)           |
| Ethanol        | 3.0            | 450°C, 30 MPa        | ±0.2 (n=3)           |

## 6. Multiple Operating Conditions

- Studies should report yields across various temperatures and pressures to understand the influence of these parameters on hydrogen production.

## 7. Statistical Analysis of Experimental Uncertainty

- It is crucial to include error bars and statistical significance in yield data to assess the reliability of results.

## 8. Benchmark Comparisons with Established Technologies

- Future studies should compare SCWG yields with traditional gasification methods to highlight advantages or limitations.
