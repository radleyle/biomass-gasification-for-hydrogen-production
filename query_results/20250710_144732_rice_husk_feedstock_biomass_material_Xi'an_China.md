## GPT-4 Analysis

**Experimental Data Found:**
- Technology: Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Gasification
- Feedstock: Rice husk obtained from a farm in Xi'an, China
- Conditions: Temperature ranging from 700 to 900 °C, Pressure ≥ 7.38 MPa, Time: 30 min
- H₂ Yield: Not explicitly mentioned in the provided context (Source: Not available)
- CO Yield: 50.24 mol/kg biomass in CO₂ atmosphere at 900 °C and 30 min (Source: Not available)
- Other yields: Carbon gasification efficiency was 94.53% in CO₂ atmosphere at 900 °C and 30 min

**Key Findings:**
- The gas yield and carbon gasification rate of rice husk gasification is higher in a supercritical CO₂ atmosphere compared to an argon atmosphere.
- The gas yield and carbon gasification efficiency of biomass gasification increases with the amount of carbon dioxide.
- Potassium carbonate is a good catalyst for enhancing gas production from rice husk gasification.

**Source Reliability:**
The data appears to be consistent and reliable as it is derived from a single source. However, the source of the data is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

**Missing Information:**
The exact yield of H₂ is not provided in the context. Also, the source of the experimental data is not mentioned.

2.1 Raw biomass material and catalyst

The original material used as the feedstock for biomass gasification is rice husk. It was obtained from a farm in Xi'an, China. The sample was sieved with its particle size ranging from 200 to 300 mesh. The results of proximate and ultimate analysis of biomass material used for the experiment are presented in Table 1. K CO was used in 2 3 this work as catalyst, it was anhydrous reagents and was supplied by the Tianli Chemical Regents Co. Ltd...

23.72 to 50.24 mol/kg biomass and the CE increased from 53.21% to 94.53% with the increase of the equivalent ratio from 0 to 1 at 900 °C and 30 min.

The mechanism of supercritical carbon dioxide gasification of rice husk is summarized, providing a theoretical basis for supercritical carbon dioxide gasification of biomass.

Biomass gasification is considered be an efficient means of biomass energy utilization. There have been a lot of studies on gasification converts biomass into gaseous products (H , CO, CH , and CO ) at high temperatures 2 4 2 with air, steam, carbon dioxide or with the mixture of air-steam, air-carbon dioxide, steam-carbon dioxide, etc. [...
