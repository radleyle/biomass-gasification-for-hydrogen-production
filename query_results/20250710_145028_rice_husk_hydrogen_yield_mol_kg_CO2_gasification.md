4 Conclusions

The supercritical carbon dioxide gasification of rice husk for gas production carried out in a fixed gasifier with the use of K CO as catalyst has shown encourag2 3 ing results. The main conclusions of this paper are as follows:

Compared with argon atmosphere, the gas yield and carbon gasification rate of rice husk gasification is higher in a supercritical CO atmosphere. The gas 2 yield and CE were 50.24 mol/kg biomass and 94.53% in CO 2 atmosphere compared to 39.85 mol/kg...

The temperature and stay time are important factors to the rice husk gasification. With the temperature and reaction time increasing, the content of H 2 and CO increased, while CO , CH decreased rap2 4 idly. The gas yield and carbon gasification efficiency of biomass gasification increases with the amount of carbon dioxide. When there is an excess of carbon dioxide, the effect of increasing the amount of carbon dioxide on gasification will be reduced.

23.72 to 50.24 mol/kg biomass and the CE increased from 53.21% to 94.53% with the increase of the equivalent ratio from 0 to 1 at 900 °C and 30 min.

The mechanism of supercritical carbon dioxide gasification of rice husk is summarized, providing a theoretical basis for supercritical carbon dioxide gasification of biomass.
