**Key Findings:**
- The addition of a catalyst in a supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere significantly increased the hydrogen yield by 26.79% and the carbon monoxide yield (Source: Context Document 1).
- The gas yield, hydrogen yield, and carbon monoxide yield all increased with the increase of the reaction stay time from 5 to 30 min (Source: Context Document 4).

**Source Reliability:**
The data appears to be consistent across the sources, indicating a high level of reliability. However, the lack of specific experimental conditions (temperature, pressure) in the sources may affect the accuracy of the data.

**Missing Information:**
The specific type of biomass used as feedstock is not mentioned. The exact experimental conditions such as temperature and pressure are also not specified.

As can be seen in Fig. 7b, the addition of the catalyst significantly increased the hydrogen production by a large amount. In the supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere, the addition of the catalyst increased the hydrogen yield from 12.32 mol/kg to 19.41 mol/kg, an increase of 26.79%. Compared to argon, the carbon monoxide yield in supercritical carbon dioxide increased from 10.65 mol/ kg to 17.2 mol/kg. This was due to the presence of large amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reacting ...

compared with that in the argon atmosphere. At 900 °C, the content of hydrogen and carbon monoxide increases by 2.02 vol% and 3.21 vol% respectively. This is because in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, the concentration of carbon dioxide is higher, reaction (5) and (7) are easier to carry out, and the content of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is higher than that of argon. Table 2 shows the comparison with other studies of carbon dioxide gasification of biomass, which could be found that the gas y...

yield, but this was at the cost of supplying extra steam. It was also observed that beyond a certain steam-to-biomass ratio, the hydrogen yield increased only marginally with most of the supplied steam going unreacted. Hence, in order to enhance the hydrogen yield of conventional biomass gasification, it was necessary to find new or improved techniques, which are simple, energy efficient, and inexpensive. The product gas coming out of the gasifier consists of gases other than hydrogen, such as C...
