## GPT-4 Analysis

**Experimental Data Found:**
- Technology: CO₂ Gasification
- Feedstock: Biomass (specific type not mentioned in the provided documents)
- Conditions: 900 °C (temperature), pressure and time not specified
- H₂ Yield: Not specified
- CO Yield: Increased from 39.79 mol/kg to 50.79 mol/kg when the ratio of CO2 to argon increased from 0 to 1 (Source: Context Document 1); Increased from 10.65 mol/kg to 17.2 mol/kg in supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere with the addition of a catalyst (Source: Context Document 9)
- Other yields: Not specified

**Key Findings:**
- The CO yield increased significantly with the increase in the ratio of CO2 to argon, indicating that CO2 plays a crucial role in enhancing the CO yield during biomass gasification.
- The addition of a catalyst in a supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere further increased the CO yield, suggesting that catalysts can enhance the efficiency of CO2 gasification.

**Source Reliability:**
The data is consistent across the provided sources, indicating a high level of reliability. However, the sources do not provide complete information about the experimental conditions, such as pressure and time, which may affect the interpretation of the results.

**Missing Information:**
The specific type of biomass used as feedstock is not mentioned in the provided documents. Additionally, details about the experimental conditions, such as pressure and time, are not provided. Information about the H₂ yield and other yields is also missing.

As can be seen in Fig. 5a, both the CE and gas yields increased as the amount of CO increased. The CE and 2 gas yields increased from 80.8% and 39.79 mol/kg to 94.53% and 50.79 mol/kg respectively when the ratio of CO2 to argon increased from 0 to 1. The greatest increase in CE and CO yield was seen when the ratio of carbon dioxide to argon was increased from 0 to 0.2, with a 3.6 mol/kg increase in CO yield, which had less and less effect on CE and gas yield as the amount of carbon dioxide incre...

the rate of carbon gasification. And when there is an excess of CO , the effect of the amount of CO on the gas 2 2 yield and CE is reduced, mainly because there is a range of contact surfaces between CO and the solid, and the 2 excess CO are not in contact to have a reduced effect 2 on the gasification. As can be seen from the changes in the gas fraction in Fig. 5b, the gas fraction only changes when carbon dioxide is added, with the carbon monoxide...
