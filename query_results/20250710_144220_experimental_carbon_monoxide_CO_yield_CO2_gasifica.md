## GPT-4 Analysis

**Experimental Data Found:**
- Technology: CO₂ Gasification
- Feedstock: Biomass (specific type not mentioned in the provided documents)
- Conditions: 900 °C (specific pressure and time not mentioned)
- H₂ Yield: Not specified
- CO Yield: Increased from 10.65 mol/kg to 17.2 mol/kg in supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere with the addition of a catalyst (Source: Context Document)
- Other yields: Not specified

**Key Findings:**
- The CO yield increased significantly from 10.65 mol/kg to 17.2 mol/kg with the addition of a catalyst in a supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere.
- The increase in CO yield was attributed to the presence of large amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reacting with the coke.
- The addition of carbon dioxide to the production of syngas from biomass gasification is suggested as a way to increase the syngas yield.

**Source Reliability:**
The source appears to be reliable as it provides specific numerical data for the CO yield. However, the lack of detailed information about the experimental conditions and the type of biomass used limits the overall reliability of the data.

**Missing Information:**
The specific type of biomass used as feedstock, the pressure conditions, the time duration of the experiment, and the yield of other gases (like H₂) are not provided in the context documents.

As can be seen in Fig. 5a, both the CE and gas yields increased as the amount of CO increased. The CE and 2 gas yields increased from 80.8% and 39.79 mol/kg to 94.53% and 50.79 mol/kg respectively when the ratio of CO2 to argon increased from 0 to 1. The greatest increase in CE and CO yield was seen when the ratio of carbon dioxide to argon was increased from 0 to 0.2, with a 3.6 mol/kg increase in CO yield, which had less and less effect on CE and gas yield as the amount of carbon dioxide incre...

the rate of carbon gasification. And when there is an excess of CO , the effect of the amount of CO on the gas 2 2 yield and CE is reduced, mainly because there is a range of contact surfaces between CO and the solid, and the 2 excess CO are not in contact to have a reduced effect 2 on the gasification. As can be seen from the changes in the gas fraction in Fig. 5b, the gas fraction only changes when carbon dioxide is added, with the carbon monoxide...
