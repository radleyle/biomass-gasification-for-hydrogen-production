## GPT-4 Analysis

**Experimental Data Found:**
- Technology: Plasma Gasification
- Feedstock: Biomass and waste
- Conditions: Not specified
- Hâ‚‚ Yield: 48.31% (Source: Unspecified)
- CO Yield: 58.13% (Source: Unspecified)
- Other yields: Tar concentration under 10 mg/Nm3 (Source: Hlina et al.)

**Key Findings:**
- Plasma gasification of biomass and waste can yield a high hydrogen and carbon monoxide content of approximately 90 vol.% (Source: Hlina et al.)
- The energy efficiency of air/steam gasification of municipal solid waste was almost twice higher than that of air gasification, reaching the highest cold gas efficiency (CGE) of approx. 60% (Source: Zhang et al.)
- The production of 1 kg of syngas required 1.78 kWh of electric energy input (Source: Unspecified)

**Source Reliability:**
The data is consistent across the sources, indicating a high reliability. However, the sources for some data points are not specified, which may affect the overall reliability of the information.

**Missing Information:**
The specific experimental conditions such as temperature, pressure, and time are not available. The sources for some data points are also not specified.
