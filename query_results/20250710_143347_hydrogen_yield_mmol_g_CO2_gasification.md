## GPT-4 Analysis

**Experimental Data Found:**
- Technology: CO₂ Gasification
- Feedstock: Biomass type not specified in the provided documents
- Conditions: 900 °C (Source: Context Document 4)
- H₂ Yield: 19.41 mol/kg (Source: Context Document 1)
- CO Yield: 17.2 mol/kg (Source: Context Document 1)
- Other yields: Not specified

**Key Findings:**
- The addition of a catalyst in a supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere significantly increased the hydrogen yield from 12.32 mol/kg to 19.41 mol/kg, an increase of 26.79%.
- The carbon monoxide yield in supercritical carbon dioxide increased from 10.65 mol/kg to 17.2 mol/kg due to the presence of large amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reacting with the coke.
- At 900 °C, the content of hydrogen and carbon monoxide increases by 2.02 vol% and 3.21 vol% respectively in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide compared to that in the argon atmosphere.

**Source Reliability:**
The data appears to be consistent and reliable as it is extracted from scientific research papers. However, the lack of specific information about the type of biomass used in the experiments may affect the applicability of the results to other types of biomass.

**Missing Information:**
The type of biomass used in the experiments is not specified in the provided documents. Other missing information includes the specific type of catalyst used and the pressure conditions of the experiments.

As can be seen in Fig. 7b, the addition of the catalyst significantly increased the hydrogen production by a large amount. In the supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere, the addition of the catalyst increased the hydrogen yield from 12.32 mol/kg to 19.41 mol/kg, an increase of 26.79%. Compared to argon, the carbon monoxide yield in supercritical carbon dioxide increased from 10.65 mol/ kg to 17.2 mol/kg. This was due to the presence of large amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reacting ...

From Fig. 4b, the gas yield increased from 23.72 to 50.24 mol/kg biomass with the increase of the reaction stay time from 5 to 30 min. What's more, it was found that the gas yield of H increased from 6.55 to 16.32 mol/ 2 kg biomass and the gas yield of CO increased from 6.30 to 17.20 mol/kg biomass. With the increase of reaction residence time, the yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide increase more, while those of carbon dioxide and methane increase less. There is even a slight drop in CO 2 pr...

Firstly, Fig. 4a compares the mole fraction of hydrogen in the syngas under different gasification temperatures and C/CO ratios. Evidently, for any fixed value of C/CO ratio, an increase in the 2 2 gasification temperature contributes to a decrease in the production of hydrogen. While under the same gasification temperature, the yield of hydrogen rises as the C/CO ratio increases. Further, Fig. 4b 2 reports the results of CO production in the syngas under different gasification conditions. Inter...
