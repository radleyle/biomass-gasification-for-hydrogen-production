## GPT-4 Analysis

**Experimental Data Found:**
- Technology: Supercritical CO₂ Gasification
- Feedstock: Rice husk obtained from a farm in Xi'an, China
- Conditions: 900 °C, 30 min, supercritical CO₂ atmosphere
- H₂ Yield: 16.85 mol/kg (Source: Context Document)
- CO Yield: 17.65 mol/kg (Source: Context Document)
- Other yields: Carbon gasification efficiency (CE) was 94.53% (Source: Context Document)

**Key Findings:**
- The gas yield and carbon gasification rate of rice husk gasification is higher in a supercritical CO₂ atmosphere compared to an argon atmosphere.
- The gas yield and CE were 50.24 mol/kg biomass and 94.53% in CO₂ atmosphere compared to 39.85 mol/kg biomass and 80.8% in argon atmosphere when the reaction is at 900 °C and 30 min.
- The addition of a catalyst (K2CO3) significantly increased the hydrogen production by a large amount. In the supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere, the addition of the catalyst increased the hydrogen yield from 12.32 mol/kg to 19.41 mol/kg, an increase of 26.79%.

**Source Reliability:**
The data appears to be consistent and reliable as it is derived from a single study that has been thoroughly conducted and documented. The study was financially supported by the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, indicating a high level of scientific rigor.

**Missing Information:**
The pressure conditions for the gasification process are not explicitly stated in the provided context documents.

4 Conclusions

The supercritical carbon dioxide gasification of rice husk for gas production carried out in a fixed gasifier with the use of K CO as catalyst has shown encourag2 3 ing results. The main conclusions of this paper are as follows:

Compared with argon atmosphere, the gas yield and carbon gasification rate of rice husk gasification is higher in a supercritical CO atmosphere. The gas 2 yield and CE were 50.24 mol/kg biomass and 94.53% in CO 2 atmosphere compared to 39.85 mol/kg...

23.72 to 50.24 mol/kg biomass and the CE increased from 53.21% to 94.53% with the increase of the equivalent ratio from 0 to 1 at 900 °C and 30 min.

The mechanism of supercritical carbon dioxide gasification of rice husk is summarized, providing a theoretical basis for supercritical carbon dioxide gasification of biomass.

The temperature and stay time are important factors to the rice husk gasification. With the temperature and reaction time increasing, the content of H 2 and CO increased, while CO , CH decreased rap2 4 idly. The gas yield and carbon gasification efficiency of biomass gasification increases with the amount of carbon dioxide. When there is an excess of carbon dioxide, the effect of increasing the amount of carbon dioxide on gasification will be reduced.
