## GPT-4 Analysis

**Experimental Data Found:**
- Technology: Supercritical Water Gasification
- Feedstock: Fructose from waste fruit and vegetable
- Conditions: 700 C, 25 MPa (Source: Context Document 3)
- H₂ Yield: 3.37 mol/mol (Source: Context Document 3)

**Key Findings:**
- Supercritical water gasification of fructose from waste fruit and vegetable at 700 C and 25 MPa resulted in a hydrogen yield of 3.37 mol/mol.
- The reaction duration, temperature, and raw material concentration are variables that affect the efficiency of the gasification process.

**Source Reliability:**
The source appears to be reliable as it is a scientific research paper. However, the data is limited to one specific feedstock and set of conditions. More data from a variety of sources would be needed to confirm these findings.

**Missing Information:**
The specific reaction duration and raw material concentration used in the experiment are not provided. Additionally, information on other gas yields such as CO, CO2, and CH4 is missing.

The focus of this paper is the process of supercritical water gasification. SCWG is a specific type of hydrothermal gasification that takes place under supercritical water conditions and leads to the production of hydrogen. Compared to its dry counterpart, it requires lower reaction temperatures, leads to lower tar formation, and, depending on the process parameters, may display relatively high conversion rates. Furthermore, hydrogen as a fuel is environmentally clean since its combustion releas...

The integration of supercritical water gasification (SCWG) for hydrogen production with a waste heat recovery system has promising potential for domestic energy solutions, particularly for small households. The study demonstrated that the optimal gasification conditions (500 C and 90-minute reaction time) resulted in significant hydrogen ◦ yields and efficient heat recovery, with a peak waste heat recovery rate of 23.1 %. The result of peak hydrogen efficiency (HE) and cold gas efficiency (CGE) ...

Supercritical water gasification, unlike conventional thermochemical gasification, obviates the necessity for drying and proves to be an efficient means of converting wet biomass into hydrogen [27] [28]. Water attains a supercritical state when its temperature exceeds 374 C ◦ and pressure surpasses 22.1 MPa [29]. Exhibiting dielectric constant, polarity, low viscosity, and supercritical water demonstrates remarkable diffusivity, reactivity and solubility [30]. Fructose was gasified at 700 C ◦ an...
