## GPT-4 Analysis

**Experimental Data Found:**
- Technology: CO₂ Gasification
- Feedstock: Unspecified Biomass
- Conditions: Unspecified temperature and pressure, reaction stay time increased from 5 to 30 min
- H₂ Yield: Increased from 20.08 to 25.18 vol% (Source: Unspecified)
- CO Yield: Increased from 27.76 to 48.72 vol% (Source: Unspecified)
- Other yields: CO₂ content decreased from 34.39 to 16.78 vol%, CH₄ decreased from 17.76 to 9.29 vol%

- Technology: CO₂ Gasification
- Feedstock: Unspecified Biomass
- Conditions: 900 °C, unspecified pressure, unspecified time
- H₂ Yield: Increased by 2.02 vol% (Source: Unspecified)
- CO Yield: Increased by 3.21 vol% (Source: Unspecified)

- Technology: CO₂ Gasification
- Feedstock: Unspecified Biomass
- Conditions: Unspecified temperature and pressure, ratio of CO₂ to argon increased from 0 to 1
- H₂ Yield: Not specified
- CO Yield: Increased from 39.79 mol/kg to 50.79 mol/kg (Source: Unspecified)

**Key Findings:**
- Increasing the reaction stay time from 5 to 30 min resulted in an increase in H₂ and CO yields, and a decrease in CO₂ and CH₄ yields.
- At 900 °C, the content of hydrogen and carbon monoxide increased by 2.02 vol% and 3.21 vol% respectively.
- When the ratio of CO₂ to argon increased from 0 to 1, the CO yield increased from 39.79 mol/kg to 50.79 mol/kg.

**Source Reliability:**
The data quality and consistency across sources cannot be assessed due to the lack of specific source information for each data point.

**Missing Information:**
The specific types of biomass used in the experiments, the pressure conditions, and the sources of the data are not specified.

As can be seen in Fig. 5a, both the CE and gas yields increased as the amount of CO increased. The CE and 2 gas yields increased from 80.8% and 39.79 mol/kg to 94.53% and 50.79 mol/kg respectively when the ratio of CO2 to argon increased from 0 to 1. The greatest increase in CE and CO yield was seen when the ratio of carbon dioxide to argon was increased from 0 to 0.2, with a 3.6 mol/kg increase in CO yield, which had less and less effect on CE and gas yield as the amount of carbon dioxide incre...

the rate of carbon gasification. And when there is an excess of CO , the effect of the amount of CO on the gas 2 2 yield and CE is reduced, mainly because there is a range of contact surfaces between CO and the solid, and the 2 excess CO are not in contact to have a reduced effect 2 on the gasification. As can be seen from the changes in the gas fraction in Fig. 5b, the gas fraction only changes when carbon dioxide is added, with the carbon monoxide...
