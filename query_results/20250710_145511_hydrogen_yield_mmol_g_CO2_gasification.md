## GPT-4 Analysis

**Experimental Data Found:**
- Technology: CO₂ Gasification
- Feedstock: Biomass (specific type not mentioned in the provided documents)
- Conditions: 700 °C, 30 min
- H₂ Yield: 7.89 mol/kg (Source: Table 2 Comparison with other studies of carbon dioxide gasification of biomass)
- CO Yield: 5.98 mol/kg (Source: Table 2 Comparison with other studies of carbon dioxide gasification of biomass)
- Other yields: Not mentioned

**Key Findings:**
- The gas yield increased from 23.72 to 50.24 mol/kg biomass with the increase of the reaction stay time from 5 to 30 min.
- The gas yield of H increased from 6.55 to 16.32 mol/kg biomass and the gas yield of CO increased from 6.30 to 17.20 mol/kg biomass.
- The addition of the catalyst significantly increased the hydrogen production by a large amount. In the supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere, the addition of the catalyst increased the hydrogen yield from 12.32 mol/kg to 19.41 mol/kg, an increase of 26.79%.

**Source Reliability:**
The data seems to be consistent and reliable as it is extracted from scientific research papers. However, the specific type of biomass used in the experiments is not mentioned, which could affect the reliability of the data.

**Missing Information:**
The specific type of biomass used in the experiments is not mentioned in the provided documents. Other experimental conditions such as pressure and the presence of catalysts are also not clearly stated.

From Fig. 4b, the gas yield increased from 23.72 to 50.24 mol/kg biomass with the increase of the reaction stay time from 5 to 30 min. What's more, it was found that the gas yield of H increased from 6.55 to 16.32 mol/ 2 kg biomass and the gas yield of CO increased from 6.30 to 17.20 mol/kg biomass. With the increase of reaction residence time, the yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide increase more, while those of carbon dioxide and methane increase less. There is even a slight drop in CO 2 pr...

yield, but this was at the cost of supplying extra steam. It was also observed that beyond a certain steam-to-biomass ratio, the hydrogen yield increased only marginally with most of the supplied steam going unreacted. Hence, in order to enhance the hydrogen yield of conventional biomass gasification, it was necessary to find new or improved techniques, which are simple, energy efficient, and inexpensive. The product gas coming out of the gasifier consists of gases other than hydrogen, such as C...

As can be seen in Fig. 7b, the addition of the catalyst significantly increased the hydrogen production by a large amount. In the supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere, the addition of the catalyst increased the hydrogen yield from 12.32 mol/kg to 19.41 mol/kg, an increase of 26.79%. Compared to argon, the carbon monoxide yield in supercritical carbon dioxide increased from 10.65 mol/ kg to 17.2 mol/kg. This was due to the presence of large amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reacting ...
