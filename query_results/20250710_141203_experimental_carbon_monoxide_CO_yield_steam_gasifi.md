## GPT-4 Analysis

**Experimental Data Found:**
- Technology: Steam Gasification
- Feedstock: Bagasse
- Conditions: Temperature of 850°C, atmospheric pressure, reaction time of 30 min, bagasse loading of 1g, water flow rate of 0.6 ml/min
- CO Yield: Increase from 8.6 to 18.5 mmol/g bagasse (Source: Context Document)
- Other yields: H2, CO2 yield increased, no significant change in CH4, C2H4, C2H6 (Source: Context Document)

**Key Findings:**
- The presence of steam in the reaction increased the amount of gas generated from 8.6 to 18.5 mmol/g bagasse.
- The increase in the H2, CO and CO2 yield and the decrease in the methane yield can be attributed to the steam reforming and water gas shift processes.
- The carbon conversion efficiency (ηc) and the dry heating value (LHV) of the product gas in the presence of steam increased.

**Source Reliability:**
The data is consistent and reliable as it is extracted from a scientific research paper. However, it is based on a single study and may not represent all possible conditions or feedstocks.

**Missing Information:**
The exact numerical values for the yields of H2, CO2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 are not provided. The specific experimental setup and the type of gasifier used are also not mentioned.

The presence of steam in the reaction increased the amount of gas generated from 8.6 to 18.5 mmol/g baggase. As shown, H2, CO and CO2 yield increased but no significant change in the amount of CH4 and light hydrocarbons (C2H4 and C2H6) were observed. The increase in the H2, CO and CO2 yield and the decrease in the methane yield can be attributed to the steam reforming and water gas shift processes (Eqs. 7-10). On the other hand, steam reforming reactions are endothermic and gasification occurs a...
