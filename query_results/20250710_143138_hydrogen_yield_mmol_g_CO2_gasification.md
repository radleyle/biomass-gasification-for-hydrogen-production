**Key Findings:**
- The yield of hydrogen and carbon monoxide increases with the increase in temperature from 700 °C to 800 °C.
- The yield of hydrogen decreases while the yield of carbon monoxide increases when the temperature is increased from 800 °C to 850 °C.
- Both hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields increase when the temperature is increased from 850 °C to 900 °C.

**Source Reliability:**
The data appears to be consistent and reliable as it is from the same study and the experimental conditions are clearly stated.

**Missing Information:**
The specific type of biomass used in the study is not mentioned.

As can be seen in Fig. 7b, the addition of the catalyst significantly increased the hydrogen production by a large amount. In the supercritical carbon dioxide atmosphere, the addition of the catalyst increased the hydrogen yield from 12.32 mol/kg to 19.41 mol/kg, an increase of 26.79%. Compared to argon, the carbon monoxide yield in supercritical carbon dioxide increased from 10.65 mol/ kg to 17.2 mol/kg. This was due to the presence of large amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reacting ...

From Fig. 4b, the gas yield increased from 23.72 to 50.24 mol/kg biomass with the increase of the reaction stay time from 5 to 30 min. What's more, it was found that the gas yield of H increased from 6.55 to 16.32 mol/ 2 kg biomass and the gas yield of CO increased from 6.30 to 17.20 mol/kg biomass. With the increase of reaction residence time, the yields of hydrogen and carbon monoxide increase more, while those of carbon dioxide and methane increase less. There is even a slight drop in CO 2 pr...

Firstly, Fig. 4a compares the mole fraction of hydrogen in the syngas under different gasification temperatures and C/CO ratios. Evidently, for any fixed value of C/CO ratio, an increase in the 2 2 gasification temperature contributes to a decrease in the production of hydrogen. While under the same gasification temperature, the yield of hydrogen rises as the C/CO ratio increases. Further, Fig. 4b 2 reports the results of CO production in the syngas under different gasification conditions. Inter...
